# veggieNinja

## Description
veggieNinja is a simple game where the player have to slice vegetables falling down trougth the screen. Player should use a mini-sword, controlling it with its mouse, to slice the vegetables in two pieces. As the game progresses, more vegetables are falling down the screen and as more the player slices the score increments. The game ends when vegetables not sliced touches the end of the screen or a piece of meat is sliced.


## MVP (DOM - CANVAS)
This is a game where player can touch the elements falling down the screen, with its mouse cursor, to change their form.


## Backlog

* Listening for mouse movement
* Once spliced the elements each side falls down with a parabolic movement.
* Introduce sound effect when elements are sliced.
* Introduce a graffic effect in movement swor when elements are sliced.
* Responsive mobile design
